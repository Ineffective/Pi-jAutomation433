Pi-jAutomation433
=================

LOOKOUT! WORK IN PROGRESS. This not even close to a usable prototype yet! lets call it v.0.0001 ;-)

JVM with Spring MVC + Rule/BPM Engine + JNI to access C library controlling 433mhz plugs

###install

#####shared libs and wiringPi
to install switch to /RCSwitchJNIWrapper/src and run 
```
sudo ./compile.sh
```
This should install our library to /usr/local/lib
If you need wiringPi as well uncomment the line saying "#./build" to build and install wiringPi as well.



Detailed Developing reports are available only for OPITZ-CONSULTING Deutschland GmbH employees (in our internal confluence). sorry bout this!
This will most likely change once we're out of pre-pre-alpha stage but for now what you got is what you get. make it work or leave it be for a while and come back later. or write me an email! ;)

### Structure and Frameworks

* AngularJS and ionic for the Mobile Frontend
* Yeoman (yo, bower, grunt) for the scaffolding, js dependency mgmt and build of the frontend
* Maven based for the backend
* Spring, Hibernate, Jackson

###Development

I use IntelliJ as an IDE. I have a Project on the root, and 3 modules. One for the entire project (which is sort of the backend), one for the RCSwitchJNIWrapper and one for the www Folder in the Phonegap (Frontend) Folder.

I deploy to the mobile device via phonegap command line (i have a run config in intellij for that).

For testing purposes of the backend without the need to actually access jni I deploy to a local jetty which I can debug and up faster than on the pi

For ad hoch UI tests i run "grunt server" within the Frontend folder which hosts my UI

### Short description
This project is supposed to bring a powerful middleware environment to the Pi and make "stupid" 433mhz plugs very smart.

* There will be a Spring MVC Application running in a JVM (J SE 8 ARM optimized hardware float)
* There should be a rule engine coming + a BPM engine
* You should be able to create profiles, groups, timers, routines for your plugs
* Everything will be accessible via REST
	* adding plugs (name, location, image)
	* create groups
	* create schedules, timers (turn off in â€¦)
	* create profiles, access restrictions (guest users)


There is a "lower level" implementation underneath java which is written in C++. This accesses the Raspberry Pi GPIO pins to send signals via a 433mhz Transmitter. 
Thanks to [RCSwitch](https://code.google.com/p/rc-switch/) for this implementation. Actually the code used is from [RCSwitch-Pi](https://github.com/r10r/rcswitch-pi) which replaced the libs to make it work on the pi. 

#### Test send with the RCSwitch

I modified RCSwitch to accept any switch configuration. So now you could send a signal to a 
plug configured as such:

11001 10101

```
cd RCSwitchJNIWrapper/src/RCSwitch-Pi 
make
send 11010 11001 1 #your own plug configuration
```
Of course for this to work you have to have a 433mhz module attached to your pi. I have it attached to GPIO pin #17 (wiringPi numbering 0)
